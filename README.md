# Folium_HK_Map_Visuals
Using Folium to visualise data with Hong Kong map

Feel free to visit my Medium post to learn more about the project details. 

Data were downloaded from [voter statistics](https://www.voterregistration.gov.hk/chi/statistic2019.html) and [census population statistics](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/sp150.jsp?productCode=B1130301) released from Hong Kong Government and pre-processed. 

The data used in the map are stored in [Consolidated Data.xlsx](https://github.com/cydalytics/Folium_HK_Map_Visuals/blob/master/Consolidated%20Data.xlsx). Feel free to play around =)
